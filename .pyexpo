; How does it work? 'path' key has a value similar to PYTHONPATH env variable.
; pyexpo can expose any module/package from specified path to command line
; according to these simple rules:
; * just simple top-level functions can be exposed
; * ordinal arguments transform to required cli arguments and keyword ones
;   become optional arguments with double dashes.
